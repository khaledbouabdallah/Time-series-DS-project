# Time-series-DS-project
This is a project for the Data Science Course in DCI Masters at the universty of Paris Cit√© for the year 2023-2024.

This projects evaluates time series forecasting methods through participation in two private Kaggle competitions.

In summary, we tried the following models: (some were more explored than others)

- ARIMA
- XGBOOST
- LSTM
- Costume Residual-CNN-LSTM network
- Temporal Convolutional Network

## Getting Started

- Python 3.9.0
- install packages by running "pip install -r requirements.txt"

  __note__: Some deep learning models require extra packages like Pytorch.
